                    Brad and Staci are professional dog breeders for Alaskan dog breeds such as Alaskan Malamutes, Siberian Huskies, and Alaskan Huskies</p>

                <h3>Alaskan dogs</h3>
                <h4>About the Alaskan Malamute</h4>
                <p>
                    <img src="images/Alaskan-Malamute-standing-in-the-grass.jpg" class="about-image">
                    The Alaskan Malamute stands 23 to 25 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 85 pounds. <br>
                     Everything about Mals suggests their origin as an arctic sled dog: The heavy bone, deep chest, <br>
                     powerful shoulders, and dense, weatherproof coat all scream, “I work hard for a living!”  <br>
                     But their almond-shaped brown eyes have an affectionate sparkle, suggesting Mals enjoy snuggling with their humans when the workday is done.<br>
                     Mals are pack animals. And in your family “pack,” the leader must be you. If a Mal doesn’t respect you, he will wind up owning you instead of the other way around.<br>
                     Firm but loving training should begin in early puppyhood. That said, a well-behaved Mal is a joy to be with—playful, gentle, friendly, and great with kids.
                </p>
                <h4>About the Siberian Husky</h4>
                <p>
                    <img src="images/Siberian-Huskies-together-outdoors-in-the-winter.jpg" class="about-image">
                    The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky’s almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue—and sometimes one of each—and convey<br>
                     a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly <br>
                     effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin,<br>
                     the Alaskan Malamute. In fact, breeders and fanciers prefer the moniker Siberians over huskies, as the latter suggests a bigger,<br>
                      brawnier dog than what is the standard for the breed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As born pack dogs, Siberians enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs; their innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs.<br>
                   This breed is also energetic and can’t resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed:<br>
                   Siberians are naturally clean, with little doggy odor.
                </p>
                <h4>About the Alaskan Huskies</h4>
                <p>
                    <img src="images/alaskanhuskies.jpg" class="about-image">
                    These dogs are the ultimate racing machines, the modern Iditarod dog of choice. They’re bred specifically for all the qualities sought in a <br>
                    top canine athlete. A team of researchers studied the genetic lineage of these popular racers and found their ancestry combines qualities of strength,<br>
                     speed, agility and endurance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alaskan huskies are descended from breeds including Alaskan malamutes, Siberian huskies, German shorthaired pointers,<br>
                    Salukis and Anatolian shepherds. Some Alaskan husky racers are even bred with wolves. As such, the Alaskan huskies are not <br>
                     recognized by the American Kennel Club as a distinctive breed – but they are largely preferred by Iditarod mushers as the dog most <br>
                     likely to get them across the finish line first.
