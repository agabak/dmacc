            <h2>Caring for Alaskan Dogs</h2>
             <h3>Routine Care, Diet, and Exercise</h3>
             <p>
             Build her routine care into your schedule to help your Mal live longer, <br/>stay healthier, and be happier during her lifetime. 
             We cannot overemphasize the importance of a proper diet and exercise routine.
             </p>
             <ul>
                 <li>
                    Supervise your pet as you would a toddler. Keep doors closed, pick up after yourself,<br/>
                    and block off rooms as necessary. This will keep her out of trouble and away from objects she shouldn’t put in her mouth.
                 </li>
                 <li>Brush her coat as needed, at least weekly.</li>
                 <li>
                    Alaskan Malamutes often have serious problems with their teeth, so you’ll need to brush them at least three times a week!
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Clean her ears weekly, even as a puppy. Don’t worry—we’ll show you how!
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    She's a large dog with lots of energy, so keep her mind and body active, or she'll get bored. That's when the naughty stuff starts.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Mals are expert diggers and climbers. It is recommended that you bury your fence and that it is at least 6 feet tall.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Malamutes can be affected by snow nose, which is a loss of pigment from the nose, making her prone to sunburn. She will need dog-safe sunscreen.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Keep your dog’s diet consistent and don’t give her people food.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Feed a high-quality diet appropriate for her age.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Exercise your dog regularly, but don’t overdo it at first.
                 </li>
             </ul>

                 Any abnormal symptom could be a sign of serious disease, or it could just be a minor or temporary problem. <br>
                he important thing is to be able to tell when to seek veterinary help, and how urgently.<br> 
                Many diseases cause dogs to have a characteristic combination of symptoms, which together can be a clear signal that your Alaskan Malamute needs help.</p>
