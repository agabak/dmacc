            The hot chocolate effect, also known as the allassonic effect,<br>
             is a phenomenon of wave mechanics first documented in 1980 by <em>Frank Crawford,</em>
             where the pitch heard from tapping a cup of hot liquid rises after the addition of a soluble powder.<br>
             It was first observed in the making of hot chocolate or instant coffee, but also occurs in other situations such as adding salt to supersaturated hot water or cold beer.<br>
             Recent research has found many more substances which create the effect, even in initially non-supersaturated liquids.[4].</p>
