            Hot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations, <br/>
            including the spiced <em>chocolate para mesa</em> of Latin America, the very thick <br/>
            cioccolata calda served in Italy and chocolate a la taza served in Spain, and the 
            thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States. <br/>
             Prepared hot chocolate can be purchased from a range of establishments, including cafeterias, <br/>
             fast food restaurants, coffeehouses and teahouses. <br/>
             Powdered hot chocolate mixes, which can be added to boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, are sold at grocery stores and online.</p>
