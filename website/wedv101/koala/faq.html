                <h3>What does a Koala bear look like?</h3>
                Koalas have soft, wool-like fur that is gray above and white below. Their fur is mostly white on the underside below the neck, <br>
                and their ears have long white hairs on the tips. The koala resembles a bear, but is actually a marsupial, <br>
                a special kind of mammal which carries its young in a pouch.

               <h3>How large can Koalas get? </h3>

             <p>         
                 <h3>What is the average lifespan of a koala?</h3> 
                 Koalas can live as long as 17 years, although high mortality rates (due to car fatalities and dogs) for males lower their life expectancy to 2 to 10 years.<br>
             </p>
             <p>
                <h3>Where do Koala's live? </h3>

             </p>
             <p>
                <h3>What type of environment do Koala's like? </h3>

             <p>
                <h3>How do Koala's behave?</h3>
                Nocturnal mammals, koalas sleep for up to 16 hours a day. They are arboreal, which means that they live in trees. <br>
                They do not live in big groups but rather prefer to be alone.
             </p>
             <p>
                <h3>How do Koala's populate?</h3> 
                Koalas breed once a year. Gestation lasts 35 days, after which one koala is born. The baby koala is very small when it is born,<br>
                 and lives in its mother's pouch for five to seven months. After this time, koalas gradually become independent and survive on their own.<br>
             </p>
             <p>
                <h3>What are some major threats of Koala's?</h3> 
                Once numbering in the millions, koalas suffered major declines in population during the 1920s when they were hunted for their fur.<br>
                 Today, habitat destruction, traffic deaths, and attacks by dogs kill an estimated 4,000 koalas yearly.    
             </p>
             <p>
                <h3>How can we protect Koala's?</h3>
                Australian national laws protect koalas, but each individual state is responsible for the animal's conservation.<br>
