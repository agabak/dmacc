                The Koala Bear National Information Center <em>(KBNIC)</em>  is the principal non-profit, 
                non-government organization dedicated to the conservation and effective management of the wild koala and its habitat.
            </p>
            <p>
                The KBNIC was formed in 2006. Since our founding  the KBNIC has grown from a small group of people interested in researching koala disease, to a well-known, 
                global organization with a strong track record in strategic koala research, conservation and community education with a huge focus on mapping 
                --<em><strong>our absolute strength.</strong></em>

                Koalas are disappearing. Loss of koala habitat and koala food trees (eucalyptus leaves) is the leading koala threat. 
                Our cuddly koalas are loved around the world. Often called a koala bear, they are actually marsupials not koala bears. 
                Please help koalas by supporting the Australian Koala Foundation.
